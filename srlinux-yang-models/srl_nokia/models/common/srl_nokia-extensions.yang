    description
      "Takes as an argument a string defining the special formatting of this type with respect to
       the info from state output.  By default the output fields are formatted according to their
       basic yang type.  This flavor specification makes it possible to transform the value as it
       is printed as part of info from state output. Applies to any cli outputs (text/json/table).
       Can be suppressed from cli by doing info detail from state.

       Currently the only values supported are: time-delta, natural-time-delta, with-units, hex, hex-with-colons

       time-delta

           When this flavor is used to display a date and time, info from state will display it as
           a delta with respect to the current date and time in the format 'dddd:hh:mm:ss ago' (for
           a past event) or 'in dddd:hh:mm:ss' (future event), where dddd is the number of days, hh is
           the number of  hours, mm is the number of  minutes and ss is the number of seconds.

       natural-time-delta

           When this flavor is used to display a date and time, info from state will display it as
           a delta with respect to the current date and time in the format 'X ago' (for a past event) or
           'X from now' (future event). Where X is natural sounding description sentence like:
           a moment ago, 15 seconds ago, an hour ago, 5 minutes ago, 3 days from now, 2 hours from now, ...

       timestamp-and-natural-time-delta

           Combination of RFC3389 timestamp and natural-time-delta in parenthesis:
           2023-12-21T12:29:28.386Z (a day ago)

       with-units

           When this flavor is used to display a value then the units text is appended after it. For example
           mtu \"9232 bytes\". Where mtu is a yang typedef of uint16 with units specified as bytes.

       hex

           When this flavor is used to display a numerical value, info from state will display it converted to hex
           value (with leading 0x and using uppercase letters for hex digits). E.g. instead of 168 will show 0xA8.

       hex-with-colons

           When this flavor is used to display a numerical value, info from state will display it converted to hex
           value where every byte is sepated by a colon (using uppercase letters for hex digits).
           E.g. instead of 10010 will show 27:1A.

       inheritance).

          Uses the sample stream mode, which sends updates every 1s

       none
          The application does not suport filtering. Limited filtering of children fields
          and containers is supported within same application model by fallback.
