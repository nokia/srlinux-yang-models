             The best restart that is supported by the application is used if neither 'warm' or 'cold' is specified. If 'warm' restart is supported that will be used, or 'cold' if 'warm' is unavailable.

             A 'warm' restart will result in the application leaving its state in IDB during the restart, and recovering it post restart. This restart type results in less disruption to surrounding applications that would depend on the restarting applications state.

             A 'cold' restart will result in a normal stop/start of the application, including the purging of its state in IDB.";
